      <QStatement>What are the steps necessary to parse XML documents?</QStatement>

However, the point is not to determine whether candidates understand the concept of a parser but rather have them walk through the process of parsing XML documents step by step. Determining whether a non validating or validating parser is needed, choosing the appropriate parser, and handling errors are all important aspects to this process that should be included in the candidate's response.</Option>
